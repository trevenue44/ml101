# ML101
Machine learning is really facinating and I've decided to start learning the workings of the field. This repository should contain my understanding of basic concepts and some basic projects I try along the way. Practicing helps improve skills. One of my practice projects is contained in a repository called [identify-digit](https://www.github.com/trevenue44/identify-digit)

The name says it all: 101 for foundation. Don't expect anything too fancy.

# Housing Price Problem
I started learning from a book called: Hands-on Machine Learning With Scikit-learn, keras and tensorflow by Aurelien Geron

In the second chapter, they walk you through solving a real world ML problem.

This repository has the my code fused with theirs and my general understanding of the concepts as I go along with the book.

Finished the chapter on the housing problem. My model isn't all that okay for deployment but that's perfectly fine because the aim of the chapter was to help me get a feel of how ML engineers work. I believe they've achieved that, with respect to me.

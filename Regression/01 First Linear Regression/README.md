# First Linear Regression
I think I've solved the easiest linear regression problem that could exist. haha.

I made my own dataset based on a mathematical relation. My goal was to be able to get this relation back when the data is fed to the model.

Yes, It worked!
This repository has the code and everything on how I went about it
